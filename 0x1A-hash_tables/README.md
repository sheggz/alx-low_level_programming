# Hash Tables
---

## *Description*
A Hash table also known as hash map or dictionary, is a data structure that \
implements a set abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. \
A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, \
into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. \
During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the \
corresponding value is stored.
